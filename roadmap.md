Perfect — let’s design a **clear roadmap** for your C++ “Mini STL” project 🧩

This will help you approach it in stages, **gaining mastery** of each concept (OOP, templates, pointers, memory management, etc.) while actually *building something useful*.

---

## 🧭 Project Roadmap: *Mini STL Data Structures Library*

---

### **Phase 1 — Project Setup & Foundation**

**Goal:** Set up the project properly and plan its structure.

1. **Create the project folder**

   * Example structure:

     ```
     /mini_stl/
       ├── include/        // headers (.h / .hpp)
       ├── src/            // implementations (.cpp)
       ├── tests/          // test files (main programs)
       └── Makefile / CMakeLists.txt
     ```

2. **Decide your namespace**

   * Pick something like `mystl` or `custom`.
   * All classes will live inside it (good OOP and organization habit).

3. **Write a simple test main file**

   * A `main.cpp` that will later test your containers.
   * Don’t implement tests yet — just make sure your build works.

4. **Plan your first class: `DynamicArray`**

   * Write down what methods you’ll need (`push`, `pop`, `resize`, `get`, etc.).
   * Think about ownership: who allocates and frees memory?

---

### **Phase 2 — OOP Design & Memory Control**

**Goal:** Get comfortable with classes, constructors, and destructors.

1. **Implement a basic OOP class structure**

   * Use private attributes and public methods.
   * Think about *encapsulation*: internal details hidden, public interface clean.

2. **Add constructors and destructors**

   * Manage memory manually with `new` and `delete`.
   * Track when objects are created and destroyed (you’ll learn the “Rule of Three”).

3. **Understand object copying**

   * Plan for copy constructor and assignment operator (deep copy vs shallow copy).

4. **Add const-correctness**

   * Mark methods that don’t modify the object as `const`.

By the end of this phase, you’ll understand *how objects and memory interact.*

---

### **Phase 3 — Templates & Generic Design**

**Goal:** Generalize your first container (e.g., `DynamicArray`) into a template.

1. **Convert your class to a template**

   * Replace the fixed data type (`int`, etc.) with a type parameter (`T`).
   * Test it with multiple types (int, double, string, custom struct).

2. **Add bounds checking**

   * Use exceptions for safety (`std::out_of_range`).
   * Practice error handling.

3. **Add resizing logic**

   * Learn about reallocation and how pointers change.

At this point, you’ll have a **generic, resizable container** — a big milestone.

---

### **Phase 4 — Build More Data Structures**

**Goal:** Reuse patterns and extend your knowledge.

1. **LinkedList**

   * Use a nested `Node` structure (contains data and a pointer).
   * Manage dynamic memory (new/delete for nodes).
   * Implement insertion, deletion, traversal.

2. **Stack** and **Queue**

   * Can be built using either `DynamicArray` or `LinkedList`.
   * Reinforce your understanding of inheritance and composition.

3. **Map (Optional / Advanced)**

   * Store pairs of `<Key, Value>`.
   * Introduce hashing or simple array-based searching.

---

### **Phase 5 — Iterators & Operator Overloading**

**Goal:** Make your classes behave like standard STL containers.

1. **Implement basic iterators**

   * Allow looping:

     ```cpp
     for (auto it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it)
         std::cout << *it;
     ```
   * You’ll use pointer arithmetic or internal references here.

2. **Overload operators**

   * `[]` for element access
   * `=` for copy assignment
   * `<<` for stream output

3. **Use references efficiently**

   * Return references instead of copies to avoid unnecessary allocations.

---

### **Phase 6 — Testing and Validation**

**Goal:** Ensure everything works correctly and safely.

1. **Write test cases**

   * For each class: construction, insertion, removal, edge cases.
   * Use assertions or a simple test framework.

2. **Check memory safety**

   * Use tools like Valgrind (Linux) or Visual Studio Diagnostics to ensure no leaks.

3. **Stress test**

   * Insert thousands of elements.
   * Check resizing, deletion, and performance.

---

### **Phase 7 — Optional Advanced Concepts**

Once your core library works, explore these advanced areas:

| Concept                                         | Why It’s Useful                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Smart Pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)** | Replace manual `new/delete` with RAII           |
| **Move Semantics (Rule of Five)**               | Optimize memory handling when returning objects |
| **Allocator Pattern**                           | Abstract memory management for flexibility      |
| **Templates with Non-Type Parameters**          | Add compile-time constants like array sizes     |
| **Friend Classes & Functions**                  | Controlled access between related classes       |
| **Namespaces & Header Organization**            | Structure like real-world libraries             |

---

### **Phase 8 — Wrap-Up & Reflection**

**Goal:** Make your project clean and educational.

1. **Write documentation**

   * Comment your classes and public methods.
   * Explain ownership rules (who deletes what).

2. **Organize headers and implementation**

   * Headers (`.hpp`) for declarations.
   * Source files (`.cpp`) for implementations.

3. **Optionally publish**

   * Put it on GitHub as your own “Mini STL” project.
   * Add a README explaining which STL features you recreated.

---

### 🧠 Final Result

By the end, you’ll have:

* A **reusable, generic C++ library**.
* Real understanding of **OOP, templates, and pointers**.
* The foundation to move into **modern C++ (smart pointers, STL internals, etc.)**.
